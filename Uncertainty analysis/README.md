## Using the code  
You can download a copy of all the files in this repository by cloning the git repository or download a zip archive.

## Dependencies  
You'll need Vensim DSS 8.2.1 to run the code. The Vensim registration must be in the same name as the Windows log in or else the code will fail.  
You'll need Python 3.7.6 to run the code. The ema_workbench package requires a conda environment, which can be run using Anaconda.   
Jupyter Lab is the simplest way to set up the environment: install Anaconda and then navigate to your code folder using the Anaconda prompt, then run "Jupyter Lab" and the Jupyter Lab IDE will open in your browser.
